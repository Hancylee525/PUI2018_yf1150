# a. verify  Null and alternative hypothesis 
## This is an interesting topic. The null and alternative hypothesis are formulated properly and clearly, but I suggest add significant level the test will choose and mathematical formula to express the null and alternative hypothesis more specificly. 
For example, $H_0$ : $Proportation_{\mathrm{old}} - Proportation_{\mathrm{young}} >= 0 $
$H_1$ : $Proportation_{\mathrm{old}} - Proportation_{\mathrm{young}} < 0 $

# b. data
## I think 7pm to 3am is probably not long enough for night. Maybe 18pm to 6am is better to use to indicate for the night. 

# c. test

## Z-test and Chi-square test I think are both proper test methods, because this is a test of proportions.

# d. suggestions

## maybe the differences between tripdutation for different seasons is also an interesting question. In january, riding time should be shorter than in June.
