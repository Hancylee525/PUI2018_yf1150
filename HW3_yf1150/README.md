This week I finished 3 Assignments individually. 

The first assignment I learn how to completely remove the history of a file on github. 
Here is the screenshot of the evidence showing that the test.csv file existed in my Lab3_yf1150 folder:

The second assignment, I import and plot a dataset I found on NYU Open Data. The dataset is about City-owned sites that are available and potentially suitable for urban agriculture. Please see the Jupyter Notebook file "HW3_2".

The third assignment, Please see the Jupyter Notebook file "HW3_3"
